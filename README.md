# automation/
This folder contains the file `magic_card_converter.py` which is our attempt at automating the conversion of cards so as to follow the format presented in M15.

# everyone's work/
This folder contains 4 textfiles, which contain the cards that we have converted so far.

A card may contain **abilities**, **triggers** and **targets** and those are derived from the card's text.


# functions-abilities-triggers/
This folder contains the *abilities*, *triggers*, *colors*, and *functions* found in the python implementation of Magic The Gathering that we are using as reference.
